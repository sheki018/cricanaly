CricAnaly is an AI workload management for sportspersons. An athlete in his/her prime can win a gold medal in Olympics or even win games single handedly for their team. But pushing the limits of his /her body constantly can expose him/her to fatigue, stress, fracture, ligament tear and also mental illness. That's why workload management is very important. This optimizes the performance of the players thereby bringing victories to the team by reducing the risk of injury, detecting excessive fatigue, identifying its causes and constantly adapting rest, recovery, training and competition loads, based on the athletes' individual physical and psychological wellness, fitness and health.
